*Guided by Krish Naik on Physics Wallah Platform*  

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

This Machine Learning project focuses on building a **forest fire detection model** using a dataset from Algeria. With real-world implications for environmental safety and resource management, this project is an excellent demonstration of end-to-end ML pipeline implementation.  

The dataset covers the period from **June 2012 to September 2012** and includes **244 instances** of data split between two regions:  
- **Bejaia Region** (Northeast Algeria)  
- **Sidi Bel-Abbes Region** (Northwest Algeria)  

The dataset contains **11 attributes** and a single output attribute (fire or no fire).  
- **Fire Instances:** 138  
- **Non-Fire Instances:** 106  

This project is structured into five core stages: **Data Collection**, **EDA**, **Feature Engineering**, **Model Training**, and **Deployment**.
